# Cloudflared Tunnel Setup  
- Verify tunnel info: `cloudflared tunnel info makesoft`  
- DNS mapping:  
@, auth, portal, forum, api → <TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com
- SSL/TLS mode: Full (strict) in Cloudflare dashboard.  
- Monitor cloudflared connection; auto-restart if dropped.  
- Traffic flow: Cloudflare → Cloudflared → Nginx → Docker containers.
