# Backup & Recovery  
- Schedule MongoDB backups (cron or GitHub Action) to `backups/mongo/YYYYMMDD.gz`.  
- Store backups off-site (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive).  
- Recovery command: `docker exec mongo mongorestore /data/backup`.  
- Test restore quarterly.  
- Document backup retention policy, restore steps.
