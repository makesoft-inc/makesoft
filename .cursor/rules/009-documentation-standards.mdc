# Documentation Standards  
- Root `README.md` must include:  
  - Project overview  
  - Tech stack: Vite/React/TS, Node/Express, MongoDB, Docker Compose  
  - Deployment instructions  
- Each service under `apps/` has own `README.md` with port, subdomain, dependencies.  
- Use `/docs/` folder for architecture diagrams and infra overview.  
- Use clean Markdown with code-blocks where needed.
