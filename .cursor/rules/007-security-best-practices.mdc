# Security Best Practices  
- Enforce HTTPS via Cloudflare SSL (Full strict).  
- Avoid running containers as root; use non-root user where possible.  
- Secrets stored in `.env`, not committed.  
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` and other sensitive environment vars are defined.  
- Do not expose service ports publicly — only via Nginx proxy.  
- MongoDB binds only to internal Docker network (not host).
