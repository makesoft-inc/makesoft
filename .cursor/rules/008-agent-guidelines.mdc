# Cursor Agent Behaviour  
- Treat each service as independent micro-service.  
- Use Docker Compose commands for orchestration (not manual `docker run`).  
- On code/architecture edits, recommend `docker-compose up -d --build`.  
- Use `sudo` for Nginx and cloudflared operations.  
- On commit to `main`, trigger GitHub Actions deploy.  
- Maintain `/CHANGELOG.md`: each update includes service, version bump, date.
