# Versioning & Branching Strategy  
- Branching model:  
  - `main` → production  
  - `dev` → staging  
  - `feature/<name>` → feature branches  
- Semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`  
- On merge to `main`, tag release: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`  
- Update `/CHANGELOG.md` with service, version, date.
